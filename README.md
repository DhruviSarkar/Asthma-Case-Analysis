## Asthma Case Analysis 
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) notebook focused on asthma-related case data. Using Python and popular data science libraries, the notebook investigates patterns, distributions, and insights from the dataset.
The dataset was obtained from Kaggle (link not included here for privacy). It includes anonymized case-level data on asthma, potentially including variables such as age, gender, region, diagnosis codes, and environmental factors.
